### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zacharie Duputel, I am a seismologist at the Piton de la Fournaise Volcano Observatory ([OVPF-IPGP](https://www.ipgp.fr/observation/ovs/ovpf)). 
I am working on different projects related to earthquakes and volcanoes (some software packages that I developed are listed below).

Feel free to check out [my webpage](https://zduputel.github.io) if you want to find out more about my research.
